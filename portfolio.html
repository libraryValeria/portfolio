     <h1>about me</h1>
     <p> hi there! i am a student at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs pursuing a degree in computer science. last year i engaged in the fullstack bootcamp at the University of Denver where i was introduced to a world of coding tools. when i'm not programming i'm knittting winter sweaters or pouring hot coco over a new movie. the last book i read was Dune (no i have not seen the movie yet). my favorite pass time though, is cooking to music. for the future i think a home with other developers who share a common excitment for the project at hand would be the fit just right. </p>
